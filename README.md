## Project Overview

This project aims to build predictive models to estimate the energy efficiency of buildings based on various features. The goal is to help optimize energy use and inform design decisions in the building sector.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [UCI Energy Efficiency Data Set]
- **Features:** [wall area, roof area, overall height, etc.]
- **Target:** [Energy Efficiency Score]

## Approach

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model selection (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Model training and evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ennin-Rashid/-Predicting-Building-Energy-Efficiency-.git
   cd -Predicting-Building-Energy-Efficiency-
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results
 
## Data Visualizations
- Scatter plots will show the relationship between each feature and the target variable (energy efficiency). Students should observe how changes in features may relate to energy efficiency, although with synthetic data, these relationships might not show clear trends.
- 
## Model Performance
- After training the model and making predictions, students will evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE). With synthetic data, the MSE value may vary, but it gives an idea of the average error in the model's predictions. The closer this value is to zero, the better the model's performance.
## Prediction vs. True Value Plot 
- The scatter plot comparing true values and model predictions should ideally show points along the diagonal line (y=x), indicating accurate predictions. Deviations from this line suggest prediction errors.
